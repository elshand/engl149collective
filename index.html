    <p style="font-family: Courier New, monospace">At the start of the Spring 2022 semester, students in ENGL 149.002 at UNC-Chapel Hill reflected on their past semester. Individually, they wrote autobiographies that narrate their experienes. Still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, these narratives represent a sample of the multifold challenges and joys that come with this unique period of college education. In preserving these narratives, the ENGL 149 Collective aims to curate our collected experiences, and take these experienes with us as we move forward in our education.</p>
